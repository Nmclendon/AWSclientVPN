This is the configuration file we used to launch our AWS CloudFormation stack. You will want to change a few things in order to personalize it for your deployment.

# Modifications.

1. Open CF_config.yaml in the text editor of your choice and search for CNE430. This is the naming convention we used to name all of our resources for this project. You will want to replace all instances of this naming convention with your own personal naming convention, otherwise you will end up with some or all of your resources being named something along the lines of "CNE430Final-TedDaoNic"
